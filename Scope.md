# HempCraft - Scope File
I brought **Weed** to **Minecraft**.

# What it do?
The very beginning, I decided to start with this file. It is the scope of the project. How it will work, what it will need to do, and most importantly, how high can we get?


## - [ ] Copy Paste wheat system (for growing)
Well its simple enough, and it should be at least easy to replicate if anything.

### - [ ] The "Hemp" plant object shall use the exact same coding methods used for the wheat system (with variation)
Makes since. Again nice and simple, and people already understand it. Make it intuitive. The variation is to make sure it grows slightly off of wheat.

Variation may be able to come though via strain. Different strains may be more potent and less 

### - [ ] Dependant on the games difficulty, plants will change habits: (Far Into The Future)
#### - [ ] Plants will take longer on harder game modes
#### - [ ] Plants can become ill (explained later) at greater frequency
#### - [ ] More water will be needed for each plant.

## - [ ] THE EFFECTS OF USING HEMPCRAFT MAY LAST ___ HOURS
Simple enough. Use it for Healing. Main reason is for healing.
The mod will use the effects from the current vanilla 
Some variants do have negative effects. But nothing critical. Maybe a pain in the ass, but hey. you're high after all.

This is going to be the biggest section as there is a lot of detail I need to get though. So where we go.

**All strains will consume your hunger bar. Only a small amount however.**


### Blacklisted Effects (NEVER USE)
- Instant damage
- Poison
- Weakness

### List of Effects
- Night Vision
- Invisibility
- Jump Boost
- Fire Resistance
- Speed
- Slowness
- Water Breathing
- Instant Health
- Regeneration
- Strength
- Luck
- Slow Falling


## - [ ] Where are the fuckin seads?
Seads are everywhere.
Different strains can be found in various locations.

There will be different strains of hemp, with verying effects, times of effects, and locations.

### Grade A Locations
Grade A can be found in any overworld biome.

### Grade AA Locations
Grade AA of course has to be harder to find. So Grade AA strains can be found in select biomes.
- Rare Overworld Biomes
- Nether Biomes

### Grade AAA Locations
- Rare Nether Biomes
- Some treasure chests
- Other rare areas.

### Rickys Special
- THE END

## - [ ] Strains.
Again different strains have different effects, and lasting longer. Some real best strains might be extremely potent in one area.
The "best" strain, will have all positive effects, cranked up, wayyyyy to high.
The "best" strain, will give the player super powers, unnatural for any moral steve.

[Real life counterparts](https://hautehealth.co/weed-grades-101-aaaa-to-a/)
(I got rid of the A grade in the real life versions, and moved everyone else up. We cant have people havin shake.)


### - [-] A Grade
The shittest grade. Absoulute garbage. Just pure shit. But its weed!
Make the god damn seeds real easy to find. Put em everywhere. Every biome everywhere. They are resilant little fuckers.

"So they are everywhere! Thats awesome! Only need I weed!"

Oh contreire. These fucking things have little to no effect.

**Effects last 60s.**
**ALL A GRADE STRAINS USES THE SAME EFFECTS**
```diff
+ Instant Health (if we can easily give like 1/2 heart / joint)
- Slowness (60s)
```
**Yields**
> Buds: 
> Leaves: 1-3

##### - [x] Strain 1: OG Kush
##### - [x] Strain 2: Chem Fruit
##### - [x] Strain 3: Trainwreck

### - [ ] AA Grade
Oh now the good shit... This means you went out of your way to find better shit. Good for you ðŸ˜€

These strains are now a little better, These strains **have no ill effects**
Each strain has its benifits, and locations.

As for the location, AA grade hemp can be acquired from villigers.
If possible there will be 1 villager who will sell you the seeds. Make it random if possible. Every villager must have at least one mother fucker with this shit.

**Yields**
> Buds: ?
> Leaves: 2-6

#### - [ ] Purple Kush (Indica)
The only indica in this grade, it has the best healing effects out of all of them.
You want something to heal you? You want this shit.

(Note for development. If it is possible to implement a system where it will draw from your hunger to force the player to eat (because its weed)).

```diff
+ Instant healing (1 level)
+ Regeneration
```

#### - [ ] Skywalker OG (Hybrid)
YOU WHERE THE CHOSEN ONE!

```diff
+ Instant Healing
+ Slow Falling
```

#### - [ ] Platinum Cookies (Hybrid)
Jump for joy for cookies!
```diff
+ Instant Healing
+ Jump Boost
```

#### - [ ] Laughing Buddha (Sativa)
Laugh through the water.
```diff
+ Speed Boost
+ Water breathing
```


### - [ ] AAA Grade
The good shit.
Where can I find the seeds?


#### - [ ] Sour Budda (Indica)
Sour Budda is **the** healing strain. Sour Budda has the same healing level as its Grade AA cousin Purple Kush, but its regeneration lasts far longer. Unlike Purple Kush, it doesn't slow you down.

```diff
+ Instant healing (2 levels)
+ Regeneration
+ Fire Resistance
```


#### - [ ] Blue Widow (Hybrid)
The blue widow gives its user Strength, and night vision.

```diff
+ Instant Healing (2 levels)
+ Strength
+ Night Vision
```

#### - [ ] Holy Grain (Hybrid)
The Holy Grain alows the user to fall slowly to the ground, and with great haste.
```diff
+ Instant Healing (2 levels)
+ Speed
+ Slow Falling
```

#### - [ ] Scout Master (Sativa)
```diff
+ Jump Boost
+ Speed
+ Luck
```

### - [ ] Rickys Special
Max out everything. Simple.

```diff
+ Night Vision
+ Invisibility
+ Jump Boost
+ Fire Resistance
+ Speed
+ Slowness
+ Water Breathing
+ Instant Health (full heart instantly)
+ Regeneration
+ Strength
+ Luck
+ Slow Falling
```

Where is it? Legend has it, the legendery Ricky's special seeds can be crafted from "a egg from a flying lizard" and something else.



## PAPERS
Oh I almost forgot. Another big aspect of HempCraft is the papers.
Each paper only gives laster longing effects. Just a modifier on the duration of each effect. This includes slowness.

### Paper
Its just paper, make it like you make paper. Easy.
Put 3 paper's in a horizontal line, you get 12 joint papers. Yeah thats right you get a shit load of them.

Put 9 papers in a complete square, and you get 36.
Why so many? because the time it takes to smoke them is half a second. One draw joints baby. Spam the shit out of them.
```diff
+ Duration 15s
```

### Cones
Cones is where its at. Once you start getting those plants growing, you will get leaves from them.
Those leaves you can use to make cones. Hemp cones.
However, they are not as plentiful as joint paper.

Cones, same as joints, is just 3 hemp leaves in a vertical line in the crafting table. One line makes 2 cones.
6 Cones can be made putting 9 hemp leaves in a crafting table.

```diff
+ Duration 45s
```

### Blunts
Made of the finest of leaves.

<!-- TODO: CRAFTING RECPIE FOR BLUNTS -->

```diff
+ Duration 135s
```


## ROLL IT UP
The rolling crafting recpies will be the same no matter the strain, or paper.
Takes 1 paper, and 1 bud to make any smokable object.
The crafting recpie will be the same thing as torches. Just show it a nug and a paper and it rolls it. Make it easy.

For actual smoking, again make it easy. While a smokeable object is in a hand, right click to take a drag and smoke it.
