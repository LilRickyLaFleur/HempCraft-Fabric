# What is it?
Simple, rather than using potions, you use strains! Different strain have different effects. The effects how ever are static, but because they are static, you must use various strains to your advantage in specific scenarios.

# What strains exist?
|Strain|Grade|Effect|
|-|-|-|
|Yard Trimmings|A|Instant Health, Slowness|
|Chem Fruit|A|Instant Health, Slowness|
|Trainwreck|A|Instant Health, Slowness|
|Miners Delight|AA|Night Vision, Haste|
|Green Golem|AA|Instant Health, Health Boost|
|OG Hunter|AA|Invisibility, Speed|
|Dolphin Daydream|AA|Dolphins Grace, Water Breathing|
|Sour Budda|AAA|Instant Health, Regeneration, Fire Resistance|
|Blue Widow|AAA|Instant Health, Strength, Night Vision|
|Holy Grain|AAA|Instant Health, Speed, Slow Falling|
|Scout Master|AAA|Jump Boost, Speed, Luck|


# How does the mod work?
Simple, find some seeds, grow some crops, harvest said crops.
From there you have 3 options, joints, cones, or blunts. Only difference between the 3 is the time the effects last for.

The recpies will tell you how to make everything! They unlock when you collect buds!

# What to expect in future updates? 
- Sell and buy hemp from villagers
- Find different strains randomly in various worlds
- Much more!
